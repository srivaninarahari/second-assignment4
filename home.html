 <P>Front-end web development, is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application 
 so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to 
 constantly be aware of how the field is developing</P>
